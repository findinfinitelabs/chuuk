Conforming to the new spelling that is presently being used in the current publications, the following diacritics will be used for the different vowel sounds. The vowels in blue are the former diacritics that you’ll see in older publications or quotations from the Chuukese Bible. The pronunciation is the same as the red letter above it with its diacritic:

a – ha	 e – egg i – feet	o – over	u – Luke á – hat	é – uh, but	 ó – on	 ú – moon ä	 ö			ü

When looking up a word, be especially mindful of words with “ö”, (note old spelling with diacritic) as they will be found in the “E” section as “é”. Also, some words pronounced as an “n” may be found in the “L” section as the “L” is pronounced as an “n” in the Chuuk lagoon,.

When looking up a word, be aware that the first letter of a word might not be a single but a double consonant or vowel.

Stand alone Pronouns: I / me,	you (singular), ( he, she, it), we / us (excl.), you (plural), they / them, we \ us (incl.)

An indicator that a stand alone possessive is needed: When a word does not show a possessive pronoun suffix ending. (see #4 below)

-ei, -uk, etc. – indicates pronoun and possessive pronoun suffix endings: The suffix endings differ with different words. In this dictionary, the proper suffix endings will be listed with the words along with the English equivalents, which are color coded to match the pronouns and possessive pronouns below.

Note: In the list of English equivalents, the third person singular is represented by “him” (pronoun) and “his” (possessive pronoun). However, as noted below, the suffix ending for the third person singular covers “him, her, it” (pronouns) and “his, hers, its” (possessive pronouns). Until you become familier with the plural inclusive & exclusive, you may need to return to the info below. Thus the note (see page 1. #4) on words with pronoun and possessive pronoun suffix endings.

Pronouns: I / me, you (singular), him, her, it, we / us (*excl.), you (plural), they/ them, we / us (*incl.)

Possessive pronouns:	my, your (sing.),	his, hers, its,	our (*excl.)	your (pl.),	their,	our (*incl.)

Example: Pronoun: álleasochis – álleasochisiei

obey	obey me

Example: Possessive pronoun: imw – imwei

house – my house

*excl. – excluding the person (s) to whom you are speaking

*incl. – including the person (s) to whom you are speaking

Often, you will note that the pronoun “i” (him, her, it) is not listed among the others. In these cases the “i” is not used as a suffix ending but stands alone.

Example: kúna – kúna i

see – see him

On some words, the last vowel is dropped to add the pronoun suffix which is indicated by (*).

Example: álisi – álisuk

to help – help you

Directional suffix endings: Examples: see “fei, -to” in this dictionary

-to: “come” toward speaker or location

-ló: “go” away from speaker

-tá: “come or go” up

-tiw: “come or go” down

-long: “come or go” in

-wu: “come or go” out

Numbers in parenthesis (1), (2): Indicates two meanings for same word depending on context.
